# Clojure on Android Examples

## Goals

The code should run and be tweakable with minimal fuss.  None of this "provide a few files and expect folks to fill in the blanks" stuff.

Make some of the existing docs and resources more approachable and familiar by providing meaningful pointers to them referenced via the examples.

Explore using a revision control system to hold a series of developing examples.

## Organization Notes

The rough idea is for each branch to contain a series of examples starting with simple arrangements and if necessary, demonstrating various features in subsequent commits.

## Hints

To access different examples, switch branches.

To see an example's development, read from the first or earlier commits.

History may be modified whenever so beware ;)
